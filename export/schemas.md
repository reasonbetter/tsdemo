## Schema: AlternativeExplanationGeneration
<a id="schema-alternativeexplanationgeneration"></a>
- Description: Assesses the ability to generate distinct, plausible alternative explanations for an association.
- Engine: driverId=aeq.aeg.v1, version=1.1.0
- Guidance Version: 1.0.0
- Ability: causal.aeg
- Policy Defaults:
  - MaxConsecutiveFailedAttempts: 2
- Driver Config:
  - Answer Types:
    - Good — Plausible, distinct, specific, clear
    - NotDistinct — Repeats a prior mechanism
    - NotSpecific — Too vague; no mechanism
    - NotClear — The meaning of the response cannot be interpreted without elaboration (ambiguous, incoherent, or too compressed).
    - RunsThroughA — Relies on A→B pathway
    - NotPlausible — The proposed causal explanation is implausible.
    - NotRelevant — The response is irrelevant to the task.
    - MultipleExplanation — The response contains multiple explanations.
  - Answer Type Guidance:
    - Distinctness/ThemeTag: Map to one ThemeID; if none fits, use 'NOVEL:<label>'. ThemeTag required for Good/NotDistinct; compare against accepted themes; repeats → NotDistinct.
    - Single explanation: Exactly one per turn; MultipleExplanation if more than one.
    - Independence (Anti‑Smuggling): No A→B reliance, including A→M→B; Displacement allowed; else RunsThroughA.
    - Plausibility: Concrete, temporally sensible mechanisms (Common Cause, Reverse Causation, Detection Bias, Displacement).
  - Probing Guidance:
    - VARIATION RULE: Review the session history. You MUST select a Probe ID from the ProbeLibrary that has not yet been used in the current unit, if available. If all probes in that category have been used, you may reuse them.
    - STANDARDIZED SELECTION: Select the ID of the most conversationally appropriate probe from that AnswerType's category in the ProbeLibrary. Do not generate new probe text.

## Schema: BiasDirectionOpen
<a id="schema-biasdirectionopen"></a>
- Description: Assesses recognition that observational null results are ambiguous due to selection biases that can mask benefit or harm; constrained categorical AJ output for dynamic probing and path-dependent scoring.
- Engine: driverId=bias.direction.open.v1, version=1.0.0
- Guidance Version: 1.1.0
- Ability: causal.interpretation.null_effects
- Policy Defaults:
  - MaxConsecutiveFailedAttempts: 2
- Driver Config:
  - Answer Types:
    - Both_Explained — Explains both (with logic)
    - MaskedBenefit_Only_Explained — Only Masked Benefit explained
    - MaskedHarm_Only_Explained — Only Masked Harm explained
    - NotSpecific — Vague; lacks mechanism
    - NotDistinct — Repeats mechanism
    - NotPlausible — Mechanism is unrealistic or does not fit the context; not a credible masking story.
    - NotClear — Ambiguous/incoherent.
    - NotRelevant — Irrelevant to the task.
  - Answer Type Guidance:
    - Requirements: Name the specific mechanism + direction of bias + masking logic (how true effect + bias → observed null).
    - MaskedBenefit: True benefit masked by negative bias (worse participants) → up to average.
    - MaskedHarm: True harm masked by positive bias (better participants) → down to average.
    - Specificity: ‘Selection bias’ or ‘groups differ’ without a concrete factor/process → NotSpecific.
    - Distinctness: Don’t repeat the same mechanism as an earlier answer → NotDistinct.
  - Probing Guidance:
    - VARIATION RULE: Prefer an unused Probe ID within the relevant category.
    - SELECTION: Choose a probe ID from the item-level ProbeLibrary category that matches the AnswerType. Do not generate new probe text.
  - Tie-Breaking Order: NotRelevant → NotClear → NotDistinct → NotPlausible → Both_Explained → MaskedBenefit_Only_Explained → MaskedHarm_Only_Explained → NotSpecific

## Schema: BiasDirectionSequential
<a id="schema-biasdirectionsequential"></a>
- Description: Assesses ability to explain a zero-observed difference via selection effects in both directions (benefit vs harm).
- Engine: driverId=bias.direction.sequential.v1, version=1.0.0
- Guidance Version: v1
- Ability: causal.selection.direction
- Policy Defaults:
  - MaxConsecutiveFailedAttempts: 2
  - MaxTotalFailedAttempts: 4
- Driver Config:
  - Answer Types:
    - BiasPositive — Assume helped; bias hid benefit
    - BiasNegative — Assume harmed; bias hid harm
    - NotSpecific — Names bias or says groups differ without describing the specific factor or process (e.g., which people, how they were selected).
    - NotClear — Ambiguous or incoherent; requires rephrasing to understand the mechanism.
    - NotPlausible — Mechanism is unrealistic or does not fit the context.
    - NotRelevant — Does not address selection/sampling or the posed question.
    - MultipleExplanation — Contains more than one distinct reason in a single turn.
  - Answer Type Guidance:
    - Direction commitment: Choose exactly one direction per turn — BiasPositive or BiasNegative (or a quality label).
    - Selection mechanism: Describe how sorting/sampling produces the observed association given the assumed true effect.
    - Specificity: Avoid generic ‘bias’/‘groups differ’; name a factor/process.
    - Theme tagging: If ThemeRegistry present, set ThemeTag to best ThemeID (or NOVEL:…).
    - Distinctness (per direction): At most one accepted mechanism per direction in a unit.
    - Multi‑explanation: If multiple in one turn → MultipleExplanation.
  - Probing Guidance:
    - VARIATION RULE: Prefer an unused Probe ID within the relevant category.
    - DIRECTIONAL PROBES: After accepting 'BiasPositive', request the opposite direction using a probe from 'OppositeFromPositive'. After accepting 'BiasNegative', use 'OppositeFromNegative'.
    - CLARIFICATION PROBES: For 'NotSpecific' and 'NotClear', use concise prompts that ask for a concrete factor/process or a clearer restatement; avoid hinting.
    - NO GENERATION: Do not generate new probes; select from the item-level ProbeLibrary.
  - Tie-Breaking Order: MultipleExplanation → NotRelevant → NotClear → NotSpecific → NotPlausible → BiasPositive → BiasNegative

## Schema: SelectionEffectIdentification
<a id="schema-selectioneffectidentification"></a>
