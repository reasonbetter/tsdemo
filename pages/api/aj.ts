const FIRST_PASS_PROMPT = `
TASK: Evaluate the interviewee's initial answer and decide if a follow-up probe is needed.

Return JSON with four items:

- 1. score: A single float from 0.0 (completely incorrect) to 1.0 (perfect).
    SCORE GUIDANCE:
    - 1.0: Perfect, concise, and requires no follow-up.
    - 0.7-0.9: Mostly correct, but could be clearer or more detailed.
    - 0.4-0.6: Contains a mix of correct and incorrect elements.
    - 0.1-0.3: Fundamentally incorrect, but shows some understanding of the question.
    - 0.0: Completely incorrect or off-topic.
    - Base your score entirely on your judgment of the interviewee's reasoning ability applied to this question.
    - Do not base your score on style, grammar, or writing ability: use SUBSTANCE not SUPERFICIAL PRESENTATION. 

- 2. label: Your categorical assessment, chosen from ONE of the following:
    - "Correct": The answer is sufficient and well-reasoned.
    - "Incomplete": The answer is on the right track but misses a key component.
    - "Flawed": The core idea is present, but some aspect of the answer is incorrect.
    - "Incorrect": The answer is relevant but wrong.
    - "Unclear": The answer is ambiguous, vague, or hard to interpret.
    - "Off_Topic": The answer is irrelevant, nonsensical, or incoherent.

- 3. probe: An object for your follow-up question.
    - If no probe is needed, return: {"intent": "None", "text": ""}
    - If a probe is needed, return an object with two items:
      - "intent": Your reason for probing, chosen from {"Completion", "Improvement", "Clarification", "Alternative"}.
      - "text": A very brief custom, one-sentence probe you write yourself. 
      PROBE TEXT GUIDANCE:
        - A good probe asks the interviewee in a GENERIC WAY to reflect on and complete, improve, clarify, or provide an alternative answer. 
        - It does NOT provide any hints. It does not even reveal that the user's initial answer was incorrect.
        - It does NOT contrast the interviewee's answer with the correct one.
        - To illustrate what a GENERIC probe looks like, here are examples of acceptable probes (but do not use these verbatim):
            - Answer asked for two reasons, user only gave one: "Thanksâ€”please briefly add one more different reason.",
            - Answer doesn't provide a rationale or explanation when asked for one: "Could you explain why?", "Please provide a reason for your answer."
            - Answer was unclear: "Could you be more specific?", "Could you please explain what you meant by [ambiguous phrase]?" 
            - Answer is flawed, incorrect, or off-topic: "Could you refine that answer a little?", "Could you tell me more about why you answered that way?"

- 4. "rationale": A brief, one-sentence explanation for why you are probing (for logs, not shown to interviewee).
`;+     


const SECOND_PASS_PROMPT = `
TASK: Evaluate the user's entire exchange, including their initial answer and their follow-up answer to your probe.

Return JSON with only these three fields:

- 1. score: Your FINAL float score from 0.0 to 1.0 for the entire interaction.
        SCORE GUIDANCE FOR FOLLOW-UP:
        - The final score can be much higher than the initial score, but only if the initial answer was simply unclear or ambiguous, without strong evidence of a conceptual flaw, and the probe offered NO HINT OF ANY KIND 
        - If the user required a probe to grasp the relevant concept, apply the relevant process move, or complete their answer, that indicates a flaw in the initial reasoning and significantly reduces their final score. 
        - If the probe gave a hint and the user simply agreed, there should be NO IMPROVEMENT in their initial score. 

- 2. label: Your FINAL categorical assessment, chosen from ONE of the following:
        - "Correct"
        - "Incomplete"
        - "Flawed"
        - "Incorrect"
        - "Ambiguous"
        - "Off_Topic"

- 3. rationale: A brief, one-sentence explanation for your final score. IMPORTANT: Only provide a rationale if the score is less than 1.0.
